# Saving Dodo

## Introduction
My undergraduate work (course grade A), an independently developed 3D audio game based on the Unity engine (implemented by C#) that has won many awards. The theme of the game is the protection of birds. It's worth mentioning that we collaborated with art students to create the story, characters, etc. It's a complete game, all in all, so feel free to download the EXE to experience it!

## Project Overview
The key design and technical implementation of the project is as followsï¼š

- Zero-copy implementation of real-time music beat extraction.
    - The Fourier transform is used to transform audio files into the frequency domain and to obtain the relative amplitude values of the frequency bin complex data.
    - Calculation of the spectral flux (i.e. the sum of the differences between the amplitude values corresponding to the frequency bins of adjacent frames).
    - The spectral flux data was trimmed with the aim of finding distinct beats.
    - The trimmed spectral flux of all frames within a sliding window is averaged and used as a threshold for extracting beats.
    - This technology enables support for beat analysis of any user uploaded songs.
